1. backend/frontend to different directories (in the root directory of code repository as the Dockerfile runs "COPY . .")
2. build and run pre-existing Dockerfiles with following additions below

# Run as non-root user
RUN useradd -m NON_ROOT_USER
USER NON_ROOT_USER

3. run the docker image with "whoami" attached (example below)

- docker run go-backend-non-root whoami
# returns 'NON_ROOT_USER' when running built image named as above WITH user priviledge changes

- docker run go-project whoami
# returns 'root' when running built image named as above WITHOUT user priviledge changes (e.g. part 1 Dockerfiles)
