A TypeScript version of the example (dockerizing the development environment) to a backend portion of an application.
See the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml (https://github.com/AventusM/fullstack_project_2020-2021backend). The repository is private, but the course author(s) will get
the collaborator rights on request. Currently the builds don't get to heroku as previously postinstall script ran after Dockerfile installed dependencies and ruined the image build process.
It will probably get handled in the next part when going through Github actions.
